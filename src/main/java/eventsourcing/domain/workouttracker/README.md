# Workout Tracker
This project is workout journal backend application that helps 
you track or journal your workout sessions. It is meant to be a 
minimal app that allow you to create a workout session and add 
workouts to the session by keeping track of the body-part, the 
number of reps, and weights for the body part. I was inspired 
to build this because I needed an app that does, so I wouldn't have
to track my workouts in a notebook everytime. The starter pack makes this
stuff really easy

This is a prototype version of the application, and it comes with
the following features:

Aggregate: Session(Workout, StartTime, EndTime)


Events: SessionStarted, WorkoutAdded

Commands: StartSessionCommand, AddWorkoutCommand

Queries: GetWorkoutBySession
